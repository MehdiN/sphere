kent_distribution
=================

Implements calculation of the density and fitting (using maximum likelihood estimate) of the Kent distribution (Kent 1982).
A unittest is performed if kent_distribution.py is called from the command line.

Implements the "BM4" distribution whose mode is a small-circle on the sphere (Bingham, Mardia 1978).

Also calculates directional, percentile contours which can be used to indicate the N% highest-posterior-density regions in the sky.
